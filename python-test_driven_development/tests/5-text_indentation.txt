The ``5-text_indentation`` module
===============================
``text_indentation(text)`` prints a passage of text with 2 new lines after
each of these characters . ? and :. No spaces at the beginning or at the end of each printed line.

Using ``text_indentation``
-----------------------

First import the function ``text_indentation`` from the module ``5-text_indentation``
    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation

Test cases:

    text with special characters:
        >>> text_indentation("On Wednesdays we wear pink. Is butter a carb? That's so fetch: I'm not like a regular Mum, I'm a cool Mum")
        On Wednesdays we wear pink.
        <BLANKLINE>
        Is butter a carb?
        <BLANKLINE>
        That's so fetch:
        <BLANKLINE>
        I'm not like a regular Mum, I'm a cool Mum
  
    text with no special characters:
        >>> text_indentation("She doesn't even go here, she doesnt even go here!")
        She doesn't even go here, she doesnt even go here!
    
     text with spaces:
        >>> text_indentation("      I'm a cool Mum       ")
        I'm a cool Mum

    text is not a string:  
        >>> text_indentation(123456)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: text must be a string
    
    No arguments:
        >>> text_indentation()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'
